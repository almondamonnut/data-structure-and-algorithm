# some useful tips using VS code to write c++
1. To add launch.json in case it doesn't appear, go to tool bar, select Run -> Add Configuration..

2. Under .vscode folder, there is a launch.json file. There you can delete all and add a configuration to reselect which compiler to use

3. If the error when compiling says unable to start debugging. Unable to establish a connection to gbd, just look at terminal view and click the trash can icon to all terminal. Doing this will clear all the previous running terminals that block the connection to gbd. Then you are all set.
